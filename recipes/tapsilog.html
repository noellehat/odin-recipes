    <h1>Tapsilog</h1>
        <img src="./Tapsilog.jpg">
        <h3>Tapa and Egg, a classic Filipino breakfast.</h3>
            <p>The word Tapsilog is an acronym that stands for Tapa Sinangag at Itlog. These are the three components of the meal. Tapa refers to beef tapa. This are fried marinated beef slices.</p>
            <p>Sinangag, on the other hand, is a word used to refer to garlic fried rice. The last three letters of the word tapsilog is derived from the filipino translation for egg, which is itlog. A piece of egg is fried and forms part of the meal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
